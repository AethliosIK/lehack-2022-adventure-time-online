I log on to the site which seems to be an Adventure Time fan site.
I can create an account on /register
By connecting, I discover a part /profile 
I can define a profile to share the favorite elements of the series.
A feature is available to import and export your profile with YAML.

The site is developed in python, it is determined by the header of the server responses:
Server: Python/3.5.2

So we can guess that the developer has used PyYaml to create his feature.dd

A simple search on one's favorite search engine is enough to find CVE-2017-18342 :
Execution Code with yaml.load.

The minimal PoC is :
season: !!python/object/apply:eval ['open("flag.txt", "rt").read()']

Flag : lh2019_{W0rK&FvnDontMiX.Unle$$YouAre4Clown}
